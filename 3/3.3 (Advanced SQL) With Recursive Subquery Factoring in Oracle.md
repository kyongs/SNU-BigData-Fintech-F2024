## 3.3 (Advanced SQL) With Recursive Subquery Factoring in Oracle

- LiveSQL worksheet에서 가급적 SQL문 한개씩 실행해보세요. (SQL문은 ;(세미콜론)으로 끝납니다. )
- 해당 예시에서는 scott.sql을 미리 실행하지 않으셔도 됩니다. 
- LiveSQL에서는 기본 제공되는 SCOTT schema의 Read Only 접근만을 허용합니다. 
- 해당 파일의 실습에서는 scott Schema에 대해 Read Only인 SELECT절 만을 사용하기 때문에 (insert, delete, update 등 데이터 조작 없음) scott.sql을 미리 실행하지 않아도 예제를 모두 실행할 수 있습니다.

```sql
-- Example 1: Print 1 to 10
with t(a) as
(
    select 1 as a from dual
    union all
    select a+1 from t where a< 10
)
select a from t

-- Example 2: Power
with mytab(a, b, c) as
(
    select 3 a, 5 b, 1 c from dual
    union all
    select a, b-1, c*a from mytab where b > 0
)
select a,5-b b, c pow from mytab

-- Example 3: Fibonacci Series
with mytab(a,b,c) as
(
    select 0 a, 1 b, 1 c from dual
    union all
    select b,c,b+c from mytab where a < 100
)
select a,b,c fib from mytab
    
    
-- NOTE: related error: "ORA-32044: 순환 WITH 질의를 실행하는 중 주기가 감지되었습니다." 
-- See on why: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24387957/getting-error-as-ora-32044-cycle-detected-while-executing-recursive-with-query
-- Also ask ChatGPT why and how to fix it. "The following query will encounter an error when run in Oracle. How to fix it?"
-- Is ChatGPT correct? 

-- A correct version 1 (using CYCLE clause)
with mytab(a,b,c) as
(
    select 1 a, 1 b, 0 c from dual
    union all
    select b,c,b+c from mytab where a < 100
)
cycle a,b,c set is_loop to 'Y' default 'N'
select a,b,c fib from mytab

-- A correct version 1 (using CYCLE clause)
with mytab(a,b,c) as
(
    select 1 a, 1 b, 0 c from dual
    union all
    select b,c,b+c from mytab where a < 100
)
cycle a,b,c set is_loop to 'Y' default 'N'
select a,b,c fib from mytab

-- In the previous case, a row forms a cycle if one of its ancestor rows has the same values for all the columns
-- in the column alias list for query_name that are referenced in the WHERE clause of the recursive member

-- you can solve this error using the CYCLE clause. The CYCLE clause allows you to specify the columns that form a cycle.
-- A row is considered to form a cycle if one of its ancestor rows has the same values for the cycle columns.

-- https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/SELECT.html (cycle_clause)

-- A correct version 2 (using level column)
with mytab(a,b,c,lvl) as
(
    select 0 a, 1 b, 1 c, 1 lvl from dual
    union all
    select b,c,b+c, lvl+1  from mytab where lvl < 10
)
select lvl,a,b,c fib from mytab

CREATE TABLE parent (
  id        NUMBER,
  parent_id NUMBER,
  CONSTRAINT tab1_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT tab1_tab1_fk FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id)
);

CREATE INDEX parent_id_idx ON parent(parent_id);

INSERT INTO parent VALUES (1, NULL);
INSERT INTO parent VALUES (2, 1);
INSERT INTO parent VALUES (3, 2);
INSERT INTO parent VALUES (4, 2);
INSERT INTO parent VALUES (5, 4);
INSERT INTO parent VALUES (6, 4);

--Result: ?

-- Can we prune node or branch? How?

--=============================================================================
-- The ordering of the rows is specified using either two SEARCH clauses
-- 1. BREADTH FIRST BY : Sibling rows are returned before child rows 
--    are processed.
-- 2. DEPTH FIRST BY : Child rows are returned before siblings are processed.
--============================================================================

-- WITH ancestor (id, ancestor_id) AS (
-- 	..
-- )
-- SEARCH BREADTH FIRST BY id SET order1 
-- --or, SEARCH DEPTH FIRST BY id SET order1
-- SELECT id,
--        parent_id
-- FROM   ancestor 
-- ORDER BY order1;

-- Practice
-- 1. Write recursive SQL which deduces all direct or indirect supervisor-subordinate pair 
--    (i.e., super_id, super_name, sub_id, sub_name) from emp table. 
-- 
-- 
-- 2. Write recursive SQL which retrieve the names of all direct or indirect subordinates of JONES in Emp table. 
-- 
-- 
-- 3. Write recursive SQL which retrieve the names of all direct or indirect supervisors of Smith in Emp table. 
-- 
-- 
-- 4. Another example using recursive SQL in Oracle: https://nimishgarg.blogspot.com/2010/12/recursive-subquery-factoring-with_28.html

---OLD STYLE: CONNECT BY PRIOR
select
    lpad(ename,(level*4)+length(ename),'-') data,
    empno eid,
    ename,
    level lvl
from
    scott.emp
connect by prior
    empno=mgr
start with
    empno=7839

-- NEW Style: RECURSIVE SUBQUERY FACTORING

with myemp(eid, ename, lvl) as
(
    select empno, ename, 1 as lvl from scott.emp where mgr is null
    union all
    select empno, e.ename, lvl+1 from scott.emp e, myemp m where e.mgr=m.eid
) search depth first by eid set seq
select lpad(ename,(lvl*4)+length(ename),'-') data, eid, ename, lvl from myemp order by seq

-- #Alternatively you can have siblings processed prior to children. Change DEPTH to BREADTH
